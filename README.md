Analysis of recall performance for news headlines across variables: word count, readability, polarity and subjectivity.

This is a Cognitive Science experiment which investigates the influence of certain variables, such as word count, readability, polarity and subjectivity, when recalling headlines.
No research had previously been conducted to analyze headlines recall, as all research has focused on click-through rates and attention spans, among other things.
Due to past research, many factors seem to come into play when looking at headlines this research is explored in the scientific paper.
Therefore, it seemed worthwhile to investigate this specific matter.

News headlines of several different events were selected from a worldwide news website. The Python programming language was then used to scrape the chosen news articles using their urls and extract relevant features for the analysis.
Python was also used to present the headlines as stimuli on a computer screen and record participants reaction time and correct/incorrect responses and all the data together in a single data frame, in the following manner:
The experiment commenced when an introductory message was shown, stating that they were to be shown news headlines. 
Then they had to give their consent to continue. The options were the following: to view the conditions, to give their consent (this would take them to the experiment) or to deny their consent (this would abort the experiment).  
If the conditions were accepted, they had to press ‘space’ to start. This would take them to the bulk of the experiment, consisting of three rounds of headline recalling in a randomized order. 
In each round, they were instructed to memorize several upcoming articles. They were then shown four news headlines in sequence, for 3 seconds each, followed by a 5-second interlude, where they were asked “Have you seen the following headlines?” and were told to press ‘Y’ (yes) if they had seen an article or ‘N’ (no) if they had not. 
After that, they had to say whether they had seen each headline in that group by pressing one of those two keys. It is important to know that there were always four shown headlines and another four that were not shown

Finally, for the analysis, the R programming language was used to conduct statistical analyses and the following things were done: 
- Determine which variables are correlated with reaction time in the case of headline recall and which specific variables predict reaction time in a constructed model.
- Determine which variables are correlated with recall accuracy in the context of headlines and  which specific variables predict recall accuracy in a constructed model.
- Determine if there is a significant difference in the means of participants' correct and incorrect responses.
- Determine if there is a significant difference in the means of participants'reaction time for previously seen and unseen headlines.

The results and possible limitations of the experiment have also been discussed in the scientific paper.

This is an experiment that has been conducted by Alex Presa Hughes (202409807@post.au.dk), as part of a subject called Cognition and Communication.
The person that conducted this experiment was a student at Aarhus University at the time.
